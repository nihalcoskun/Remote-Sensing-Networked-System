Project Summary

For this project, a networked system comprising a gateway, a server, two sensors (temperature and humidity), and other components will be created. For temperature and humidity sensors, the sensors create random readings, which they periodically transmit to the gateway over TCP and UDP, respectively. The gateway keeps an eye on sensor activity and alerts the server to problems. In addition to receiving data and completing a handshake, the server retains device information. It has an online interface that shows humidity and temperature information on several URLs. The humidity sensor's ability to provide the most recent measurement upon request is an advantage. Without the need for additional libraries, the implementation—which emphasizes socket programming and multi-threaded server processes—can be done in any language. Every process needs log files containing messages that have been delivered and received.
 
The sensor generates data at specific intervals, and the gateway, which acts as the intermediary component between the sensor and the server, facilitates the connection between them. The server cannot directly connect to the sensor; instead, the gateway establishes a connection to the sensor, requests data, and the sensor provides the data to the gateway.
Solution Approach
The project employs socket programming in JavaScript. The server's multithreaded architecture ensures efficient management of simultaneous sensor data streams. Data parsing and handling mechanisms are implemented for robust operation. Error handling is crucial, especially in the UDP communication where data loss can occur. The solution approach for this project can be described in extensive detail, focusing on each component:

Sensor Implementation:

•	Temperature Sensor: Utilizes TCP for data transmission. This choice ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of sensor data. The sensor is coded to periodically send temperature readings to the gateway.

•	Humidity Sensor: Employs UDP, which is faster but less reliable than TCP. This sensor sends humidity data at regular intervals, accepting the inherent risk of data loss or order inconsistency that comes with UDP.

Gateway Implementation:

•	Data Reception: The gateway is designed to receive data from both sensors. For the temperature sensor, it establishes a TCP connection, guaranteeing data integrity. For the humidity sensor, it listens for UDP packets, which may arrive out of order or get lost.

•	Data Processing: The gateway parses the received data, potentially implementing error checking and correction mechanisms, especially for the UDP stream.

•	Forwarding to Server: Once the data is processed and formatted, the gateway forwards it to the server. The exact protocol for this communication isn't specified but is likely TCP for its reliability.

Server Implementation:

•	Multithreading: The server's multithreaded design allows it to handle multiple incoming connections simultaneously. This is crucial for scalability and ensures that the server can process data from both sensors without bottlenecks.

•	Data Management: The server is responsible for storing the received data in a structured format, potentially in a database, for easy retrieval and analysis.

•	Web Interface: The server also hosts a web interface, providing users with access to the sensor data. This interface could include real-time data displays, historical data analysis, and possibly alerts or notifications based on specific sensor readings.

Overall System Integration:

•	Network Communication: Careful consideration is given to the network aspects, including IP addressing, port selection, and handling network exceptions.

•	Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the system to deal with potential issues like network failures, data corruption, or unexpected disconnections.

Bonus Implementation:

Humidity Sensor (sensors.js):

•	It runs a UDP server to listen for specific requests from the gateway.

•	Upon receiving a 'REQUEST_LAST_HUMIDITY' command, it responds with the latest humidity reading.

Gateway (gateway.js):

•	Listens for 'GET_LATEST_HUMIDITY' command from the server via UDP.

•	Sends a 'REQUEST_LAST_HUMIDITY' message to the humidity sensor and relays the sensor's response back to the server.

Server (server_multithreaded.js):

•	Facilitates user-initiated requests for the latest humidity data through the web interface.

•	Sends a 'GET_LATEST_HUMIDITY' message to the gateway via UDP and displays the received data on the web interface.

Protocols Used:

UDP is used for communication between the server and gateway, and between the gateway and the humidity sensor. This choice emphasizes speed and efficiency over the reliability of data transmission.
This implementation allows real-time retrieval of the latest humidity data upon user request, adding an interactive element to the web interface.

Encountered Problems and Solutions

•	Reliable Sensor-Gateway Communication: Implemented TCP for temperature data to ensure reliability. For humidity data, UDP was chosen for its simplicity, accepting the potential for data loss.

•	Concurrency in Server: To handle multiple sensor data streams concurrently, a multithreading approach was adopted in the server design.

•	Data Parsing and Error Handling: Robust parsing mechanisms were developed to handle various data formats and potential transmission errors.


Unresolved Issues

The provided documents and code do not explicitly mention any unresolved issues. However, ongoing monitoring of server logs and system performance is recommended to identify and address any emergent problems.

Usage Explanation

Users can monitor environmental conditions through the web interface provided by the server. The system automatically collects, processes, and displays temperature and humidity data, making it useful for environmental monitoring or automated control systems in various settings.


Protocol Details

•	Temperature Sensor to Gateway: Uses TCP for reliable data transmission.

•	Humidity Sensor to Gateway: Employs UDP, with less emphasis on reliability.

•	Gateway to Server Communication: Likely involves TCP for consistent and reliable data transfer.
•	Server: The multithreaded design enables the server to efficiently handle data from multiple sources without performance degradation.
